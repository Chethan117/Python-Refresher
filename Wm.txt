As per your request, I have reanalyzed the metric data, excluding the figures from January 31, 2025. The findings are as follows:

Dispute Complaints: Excluding January 31, the total number of dispute complaints is 160. Including this date, the count is 165.

Complaints to Customer Rate: This metric shows a slight change from 0.0034% (including January 31) to 0.0033% (excluding January 31).

Metric Y: Previously recorded at 93, this metric has adjusted to 91 upon exclusion of the specified date.

Total Record Count: The total record count has decreased from 176 to 171 after omitting the data from January 31.

These adjustments indicate minimal impact on the overall metrics when excluding the data from January 31, 2025. The updated figures have been reflected in the shared sheet for your review.

Please let me know if you require any further analysis or have additional questions.

Best regards,
